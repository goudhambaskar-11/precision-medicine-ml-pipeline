# 🧬 Precision Medicine ML Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline
using gene expression–style data, inspired by real-world precision
medicine and translational biology workflows.

The goal is to predict sample condition (e.g., healthy vs infected)
based on gene expression features.

---

## Biological Motivation
Gene expression profiling is widely used in:
- cancer diagnostics
- infectious disease research
- drug response prediction

This project mirrors the analytical logic used in these domains,
from data normalization to model interpretation.

---

## Dataset
- Simulated gene expression data
- 100 samples × 20 genes
- Binary condition label:
  - `0` = Healthy
  - `1` = Infected

The dataset structure mimics qPCR / RNA-seq expression matrices.

---

## Pipeline Steps
1. Data simulation
2. Feature normalization (z-score)
3. Train–test split
4. Logistic Regression (baseline model)
5. Random Forest (non-linear model)
6. Model evaluation
7. Biological interpretation of important genes
